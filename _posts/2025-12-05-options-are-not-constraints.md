title: Options Are Not Constraints
---

This short article is a gentle reminder to myself.
Way too often, I see my options as constraints.

> Should I go for a run, a hike, climbing? Should I continue this task, start this project, take a break?

I have to keep in mind that simply having these options is a form of wealth.
Being able to overthink these decisions is an incredibly precious thing.

So, yes, [decision fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue) is real, and we shouldn’t ignore it.
We should probably even try to reduce the number of decisions we have to make to the bare minimum to be able to stay focused on what matters.

But don’t get me wrong, having no options is also very real, and certainly a bigger problem.

Sometimes, remembering that outside my head there is a concrete world waiting for me to take opportunities without thinking too much is actually pretty nice.

I thought a lot about this after watching [this video](https://youtu.be/CnIfjBTJ5bw?si=XckiYuWfsRBw-Yu6) by Josh Romero.
